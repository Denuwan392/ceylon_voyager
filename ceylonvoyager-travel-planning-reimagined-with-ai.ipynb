The park is divided into several blocks, with Block 1 being the most visited. The best time to visit Yala is during the dry season from February to June, when animals gather around waterholes. Most safaris are conducted in open jeeps with experienced guides, and early morning or late afternoon tours provide the best wildlife viewing opportunities.\"\"\"\n",

The town is a haven for hikers and nature lovers, offering some of the island’s most rewarding trekking experiences. Two of the most popular hikes are to Ella Rock, a moderately challenging trail that rewards hikers with sweeping views over the valleys, and Little Adam’s Peak, a shorter and easier trek ideal for sunrise or sunset. Ella is also home to the iconic Nine Arch Bridge, an impressive colonial-era railway viaduct surrounded by dense jungle and tea fields, best visited when a train passes across its arches. Other highlights include the cascading Ravana Falls, visits to working tea factories like Halpewatte for tours and tastings, and hands-on Sri Lankan cooking classes. The best time to visit Ella for hiking and outdoor activities is during the dry season from December to March.
